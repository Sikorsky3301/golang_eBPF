1. How the Highlighted Constructs Work
cnp := make(chan func(), 10)

Creates a buffered channel that can hold up to 10 function values
The channel type is chan func() - it transports functions with no parameters and no return values
Buffered means it can store 10 functions before blocking on send operations

for i := 0; i < 4; i++

Creates exactly 4 worker goroutines
Each iteration spawns a new concurrent worker

go func() { for f := range cnp { f() } }()

Launches an anonymous goroutine (worker)
Each worker runs an infinite loop: for f := range cnp
When a function arrives on the channel, the worker executes it with f()
The range continues until the channel is closed

2. Use Cases for These Constructs
Worker Pool Pattern Applications:

Web servers: Handle HTTP requests concurrently
Image processing: Resize multiple images in parallel
Database operations: Process multiple queries simultaneously
File processing: Handle large batches of files
Task queues: Execute background jobs

Example use case:
go// Process multiple URLs concurrently
for _, url := range urls {
    cnp <- func() {
        response := fetchURL(url)
        processResponse(response)
    }
}
3. Significance of the For Loop with 4 Iterations

Concurrency level: Limits parallel execution to 4 workers maximum
Resource control: Prevents unlimited goroutine creation
Performance tuning: 4 workers might match CPU cores or optimal throughput
Load balancing: Distributes work across multiple workers

4. Significance of make(chan func(), 10)
The buffer size of 10 provides:

Decoupling: Producers can send up to 10 functions without blocking
Burst handling: Accommodates temporary spikes in work
Performance: Reduces blocking between producers and consumers
Flow control: Prevents unlimited memory usage from unbounded queuing

5. Why "HERE1" is NOT Getting Printed
The main goroutine exits immediately! Here's what happens:
gocnp <- func() { fmt.Println("HERE1") }  // Function sent to channel
fmt.Println("Hello")                    // Prints immediately
// main() exits here!
Execution flow:

4 worker goroutines start and wait for functions
Anonymous function containing "HERE1" is sent to buffered channel
fmt.Println("Hello") executes immediately
main() exits, terminating the entire program
Worker goroutines never get a chance to process the function

To fix this, you need to wait:
go// Add this before main() exits:
time.Sleep(100 * time.Millisecond)
// Or use a sync.WaitGroup
// Or close the channel and wait for workers to finish
